# AndyTechGuy's Simple World V2.0

There has been some trouble brewing in simple world...

Simple world has historically been known as the most simple place in the world; a place to relax and be free from the issues of the world. But, some of the younger citizens have been complaining about this simplicity, stating that Simple World is falling behind all other map generators. The elders of the land and the youth of the land squabbled about this for days. The youth rashly wanted total reform, but the elders were stuck in their old simple ways. Eventually, the town council agreed that three things would be added to the world, but no more than that. Here are the things that were mutually agreed upon:

## Features

### Trees
One thing that everyone agreed on was the addition of some natural flora, in the form of trees. They had a visual appeal, and the livable oxygen was a nice addition. The council saw the trees of a nearby generator, (MineTown, I believe they called it) and used them as a reference for their trees:

### Mountains/Oceans
This change was a little less mutual. It was initially heavily opposed by the elders, stating that "Simple World was never made to extend several chunks in the air!" But after a little bit more convincing (and a lot more editing of the tree's border regions), the mountains proposal was approved. To help build the mountains, a machine was ~~stolen~~borrowed from the nearby Tutorial World that could generate mountains hundreds of blocks into the air, as far as the eye could see:

Oceans were produced a little less diplomatically. One day, a disgruntled citizen broke into the labratory of the scientist responsible for the mountain generation. While trying to find valuables to steal, the thief knocked over the mountain machine, activating it while turned upside-down. This resulted in large holes in the ground all over Simple World! But, rain water ran in to fill these holes, and what resulted were these oceans that are a major source of tourism for Simple World today:

### Caves
This change, oddly enough, was requested by the elders! They found that up on the newly made mountains, it was hard to find a place to relax/sleep anywhere! They needed a place that was shielded from the elements, and that they can find anywhere. Caves were proposed as a solution to this problem; they can be found anywhere and can be used as a good sleeping spot. These caves also extend far underground, so the young folk can explore in their spare time for exercise. These caves were a universal success:

With these changes, there was peace in Simple World at last....
